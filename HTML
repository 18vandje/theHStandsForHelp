        <h2>Do you or someone else need help??</h2>
        <p>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Yet people avoid getting attention that they would benefit from, because of the stigma of "getting help." <br>
          Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment. Protecting one's image is a top priority for many people as showing the need for professional attention comes across as weak. But there is strength in using the resources available to you to help yourself. Addressing problems is the smart decision to make as well, as research shows that untreated children with anxiety disorders are at higher risk to perform poorly in school, miss out on important social experiences, and engage in substance abuse. There are many ways to access helpful resources completely anonymously. <br>
          If you or someone you know could benefit from talking to someone about the things they are going through or how they are feeling, there are many resources out there for that very purpose. Talking to a professional in the community can be the help needed by attaching your resource with a face, and each professional has their own style of therapy, from musical therapy to meditation to the traditional style of talking it out. Talking to a professional online has its perks as well, such as being able to talk to them from the comfort of one's home, and completely anonymously. One thing in common with all professionals who are ready and wanting to help you? Complete confidentiality. They are legally bound to uphold secrecy with the things discussed between themselves and those that come to them. Below is a list of resources for getting help.</p>
