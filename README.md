# theHStandsForHelp
// WUHS: the H stands for Help
Link to project on CodePen: https://codepen.io/18vandje/full/pVrgdV/

Goals: Education and awareness of the importance of mental health; Connecting users with options to receive help from professionals or on their own.

This website was started with the vision of replacing the current Counseling Office webpage on the Woodstock Union High School Middle School website. This website is not ready for implementation at this time, but with updates and tweaks, has much potential to be there in good time.

Update 1.01: "The H Stands for Help" renamed to "The Counseling Corner"

Update 2.01: The Counseling Corner patched with the contact information and names of each of the four guidance counselors at Woodstock Union High School. Future patch: add comprehensive bios that list their specialties, licensure, history of education, and any other appropriate information. 

Update 2.02: The Counseling Corner lacks a functioning interactive display consisting of boxes that change to display data on teens suffering from depression upon user hovering over them.

Final update, as of 5/29/18: The website has met the inital goals of providing statistics on teenage mental health, addressing the "getting help" stigma, and presenting different resources for getting help to users. There is much room for improvement in the graphics (i.e. the scroll bar in the statistic squares when hovered over) however the current website is pleasant to the eye and usable.

Goals for future edits:
    -change the font color of the statistic squares when hovered over
    -have the links under "more resources" be an internal pop up on the page instead of opening to a new page
